## üî¨ Mutation-to-Binding Site Mapping in Human Genes (Analysis-1)
This repository contains the first part of a bioinformatics project focused on identifying whether amino acid (AA) mutations in human genes occur within or outside of known protein binding sites.

## üìå Objective
To evaluate the functional impact of mutations by determining if they fall within critical binding regions of proteins‚Äîsuggesting potential disruption to molecular function, disease relevance, or drug targeting potential.

## üß¨ Data Sources
We used mutation data from major genomic databases:
COSMIC (Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer)
dbSNP (Database of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms)
ClinVar (Clinical Variants Database)
These were preprocessed to remove duplicates and merged into a unified dataset of:
~2,412 unique genes
>840,000 amino acid mutations

## üßæ Workflow Summary
## 1. Gene & Mutation Integration
Unified mutations (p.A336T, p.T89Y, etc.) were gathered for each gene.
Each entry contains: GENE_NAME, UniProt_ID, MUTATION_AA, binding site positions, and other metadata.

## 2. UniProt Binding Site Extraction
For each gene, we retrieved binding site residue positions from UniProtKB, which included:
Single positions (e.g., 54)
Ranges (e.g., 70‚Äì100)
Positions were parsed using custom logic to create a set of valid positions per gene.

## 3. Mutation Position Extraction
From entries like p.H45G, the numeric position (e.g., 45) was extracted.
These were compared against the gene's known binding site positions.

## 4. Classification
Each mutation was labeled as:
Inside Binding Site: if its position matched the parsed binding site set
Outside Binding Site: otherwise

## 5. Result Summary
For each gene, we calculated:
Total number of mutations
Number of mutations inside vs. outside binding regions
Percentage of binding-site-associated mutations

## üìä Key Results
Total genes analyzed: 2,412
Total amino acid mutations: 844,538
Mutations inside binding sites: 16,612
Mutations outside binding sites: 827,926
Percentage of mutations in binding regions: 1.97%

| **Metric**                        | **Value** |
| --------------------------------- | --------- |
| Total Genes Analyzed              | 2,412     |
| Total Amino Acid Mutations        | 844,538   |
| Mutations Inside Binding Sites    | 16,612    |
| Mutations Outside Binding Sites   | 827,926   |
| **Percentage in Binding Regions** | **1.97%** |


## üß† Insights
Binding sites are highly conserved, with a disproportionately low mutation frequency.
Only ~2% of all mutations affect known binding residues‚Äîsuggesting evolutionary pressure to preserve these functionally critical regions.
This insight could inform drug design and pathogenic variant filtering.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, Regex, Matplotlib)
UniProt API (for binding site & FASTA data)
Manual curation from COSMIC, dbSNP, ClinVar
