ðŸ§  Insights
Binding sites are highly conserved, with a disproportionately low mutation frequency.
Only ~2% of all mutations affect known binding residuesâ€”suggesting evolutionary pressure to preserve these functionally critical regions.
This insight could inform drug design and pathogenic variant filtering.
